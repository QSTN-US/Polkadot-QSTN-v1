**The QSTN survey marketplace offers a streamlined onboarding process, guiding users through the creation of a Polkadot.js wallet. Users seamlessly connect their wallet to the web application, signing necessary authorizations for engaging in the survey marketplace. Notably, users solidify their participation by saving their "survey ID" on a local Substrate chain, creating immutable proof of their completion within the QSTN ecosystem, leveraging the security of their Polkadot.js wallet.**
