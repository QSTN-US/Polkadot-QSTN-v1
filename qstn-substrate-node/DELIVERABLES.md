## Build a Substrate pallet for QSTN survey management, integrating it with a user interface, handling DOT transactions.

### Set Up the Substrate Development Environment
- Create a new Substrate project.
- Set up the necessary development tools, including Substrate Node Template.

### Connect to Local Substrate Chain
- Set up a local Substrate chain for testing and development.
- Ensure that the survey pallet can interact with this local chain.

### Design the Survey Pallet
- Define the data structures for surveys, responses, rewards, and user interactions.
- Create the necessary storage items for the pallet.
- Develop the logic for businesses to create and manage surveys.
- Define the pallet's extrinsics for survey creation and modification.


### Implement User Survey Interaction with the pallet
- Develop the logic for users to interact with surveys.
- Implement the ability for users to complete surveys and earn rewards.
- Develop the logic for handling DOT transactions within the pallet.
- Ensure that users can withdraw rewards and businesses can fund surveys securely.
- Integrate the ability for businesses to fund the survey pallet with DOT tokens.
- Ensure that the funds are managed securely.
- Implement the functionality to record survey completion and rewards in the user's data wallet.
- Ensure that this information is stored securely and accurately.

### Develop the Survey Pallet UI
- Create a user-friendly UI for DOT users to interact with the pallet.
- Include options to connect Polkadot JS wallets, withdraw rewards, fund surveys, and mint NFTs.


### Test and Debug
- Thoroughly test the entire system, including the pallet, UI, DOT transactions, and ZKP integration.
- Identify and fix any bugs or issues.

### Documentation
- Create comprehensive documentation for developers and users.
- Include instructions on how to use the survey pallet, UI, and interact with the local Substrate chain.

### Final Testing and Deployment
- Perform final testing on the entire system.
- Prepare for deployment on the testnet or a suitable network.
