## QSTN Survey and Reward Mechanism Pallet Testing Guide

### Overview

This testing guide outlines the steps to test the Polkadot Substrate pallet implementing survey and reward mechanisms for QSTN. Ensure that the QSTN pallet is integrated into your Substrate runtime. This guide focuses on functional and integration testing.

### Prerequisites

1. **Setup Development Environment:**
   - Install Rust and Substrate development environment.
   - Ensure that the QSTN pallet is integrated into the Substrate runtime.

2. **Testing Framework:**
   - Use Substrate's testing framework to execute tests.

### Testing Steps

#### **Unit Testing:**

   - Verify that each function within the QSTN pallet is tested independently.
   - Test survey creation, submission, and reward distribution functions separately.
   - Validate the correctness of calculations and state transitions.

#### **Integration Testing:**

   - Test the interactions between the QSTN pallet and other pallets in the Substrate runtime.
   - Ensure compatibility with existing modules like balances, timestamp, oracles, etc.

#### **Runtime Testing:**

   - Create a custom Substrate runtime with the QSTN pallet integrated.
   - Execute basic runtime tests to ensure the pallet functions as expected in the overall runtime environment.

#### **Scenario Testing:**

   - Develop test scenarios that mimic real-world usage:
     - Create and deploy surveys.
     - Simulate user participation and submission.
     - Verify correct reward distribution.

#### **Event and Error Handling:**

   - Ensure that events emitted by the QSTN pallet are correct and informative.
   - Validate error handling mechanisms for invalid inputs or unexpected situations.

#### **Documentation Validation:**

   - Cross-verify the documentation to ensure it accurately represents the QSTN pallet's functionalities.
   - Confirm that any changes to the code are reflected in the documentation.
